Day 2: Clarens to Rouxville

<p> <strong>The one with the empty roads, fish and chips, and sweet cappuccinos in bed.</strong> 
</p> 
<p> We woke early, the cold creeping in through the windows. Bella Rosa had promised breakfast at 7, but we were up before that, packing the bikes and getting ready to go. By the time we were done, the timing was perfect — and honestly, a warm coffee was exactly what we needed. The breakfast room was empty—no host in sight—just a table set with a French press and two plates of scones and fruit. </p> <p> My dad, still full of morning energy, spotted a traditional straw Mokorotlo hat on display and couldn’t resist. He posed while I snapped a quick photo. Of course, right as the shutter clicked, the host walked in. He tossed the hat back like a guilty schoolboy, and we giggled our way back to the table. We were tired, but in that good, slightly silly way. </p> <p> Just as we were thinking the fruit wouldn’t be enough to ride on, hot plates arrived—bacon and eggs, simple but perfect. With full bellies and warm coffee in our veins, we were ready to hit the road. </p> <p> The ride out of Clarens was magic. Empty roads, golden grasslands, and the kind of silence that makes you breathe slower. We were skimming the edge of Lesotho, and while the mountains stayed just out of reach, the sense of space was massive. Hours went by without seeing another soul. I could’ve ridden like that forever. </p> <p> It was on our second stop, somewhere in the middle of nowhere, that we realised our fuel situation might become a problem. A quick search showed the next garage on our route was closed—it was Sunday, after all—and the following one was too far. That’s how we ended up veering off our route toward Tweespruit, just hoping to make it. </p> <p> Father’s fuel light blinked as we rolled in - perfect timing. Tweespruit felt like a town more populated by cows than people, but it had what we needed and that was enough. After filling up, we got back on track. The landscape stayed flat and wide, surprisingly gentle for being so close to Lesotho, but ideal for a relaxed cruise. I kept getting blasted in the face by cold, dry air, but I didn’t mind. My ass, however, had different opinions. </p> <p> As we neared Zastron, I made a quiet decision to stop there. My mom had mentioned visiting a place called Zastron as a kid, and since we had time to spare and needed meat for the evening braai, I thought—why not? Zastron turned out to be tiny, but not without its charm. We found a Spar, and while my dad went in to buy supplies, I stayed behind with the bikes. </p> <p> From where I sat, I finally had a decent view of the surrounding hills. That moment was cut short by a small boy asking for money—then asking again. And again. I had no cash, and eventually, he wandered off. When my dad came out, he had two plastic bags and a huge grin. “Fish and chips,” he said, like it was a treasure. </p> <p> We didn’t want to eat right there—too many people around—so we rode off, two grown men with food on their laps, and found a quiet spot near the post office. Bikes parked, we tucked into that greasy, salty fish and chips like it was the best thing we’d ever eaten. It kind of was. </p> <p> Only problem? The salt and vinegar hit my dry, windburned lips like acid. I made a proper noise about it, but that didn’t stop me. I ate every bite. We saw the boy again and handed him what was left. </p> <p> With braai meat now balancing on my lap, we rode the final stretch into Rouxville. The town was tiny, even by today’s standards. Our B&B turned out to be a small house filled with the kind of chaos I love—ponies, pigs, ducks, goats, chickens. It felt more like a small farm than a guesthouse. </p> <p> We settled in with a coffee, ready to make our braai. The “braai” area turned out to be a grimy old gas grill, but that didn’t stop us. We laughed and chatted as the meat cooked. My dad asked if they had “fake-achinos”—his term for those instant cappuccino sachets—because we were both tired of the ever-present Ricoffy. The host reappeared with two sachets like it was a gift. That night, we drank those sickly sweet cups in bed like it was a luxury. </p> <p> The shower was hot, the blankets were heated, and the toilet paper came with a little sticker of a smiley face. Fancy stuff. </p> <p> No TV that night. Just warmth, tired muscles, and a quiet mind. We were two days in, and it already felt like we were in another world. </p> </div>
