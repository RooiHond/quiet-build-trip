            <strong>The one with the long road, cold wind, and first vanilla milkshake.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            My dad and I packed the night before. He wanted to leave before sunrise, 
            but I managed to negotiate a slightly later start. I told him, 
            <em>“Let’s wait for the sun. It’s going to be freezing.” </em> <br />
            He grumbled, but I could tell he agreed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were heading to <strong>Clarens</strong> that night, the first destination we’d picked.<br /> 
            As we loaded the bikes, my wife came out in her bathrobe to wave us off. <br />
            I felt a knot in my chest. Saying goodbye was hard—I already missed her.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Pulling out of Pretoria, I felt torn. I wanted to turn around and crawl back into her warm embrace… 
            and at the same time, I wanted the road to never end.
          </p>
          <p>
            We took the back roads, winding through parts of Gauteng I’d never seen before. 
            The city faded away, replaced by open fields, rolling hills, and eventually, mountains 
            that looked like something out of Natal. The wind was relentless, trying its best to blow us off course, 
            but we pressed on.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time we reached <strong>Bethlehem</strong>, our necks were shot and our hands frozen. <br />
            We pulled into a roadside diner with old cars converted into benches and tables. <br />
            It was quirky and quiet—<em>perfect</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ordered a <strong>vanilla milkshake</strong>—the first of many to come on this trip. 
            My dad had a coffee, and I swear, he looked more content than I’d seen him in months. 
            He’s a serious coffee drinker, so when he said it was good, I believed him. 
            Maybe it was the coffee, or maybe it was just the satisfaction of earning it after a long, cold ride.
          </p>
          <p>
            We both had massive burgers. The service was slow, but it didn’t matter.<br /> We had nothing but&nbsp;time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was overheating from all my layers, even though the wind was still biting, 
            so I peeled off thermal gear and stuffed it into every available nook in my luggage. <br />
            Then we were off again. Not far to go now.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we rode into <strong>Clarens</strong>, we were flanked by dramatic rock formations and layered mountains 
            that made me itch to go climbing. We found our place for the night, and I could finally give my backside a&nbsp;break.
          </p>
          <p>
            We rested for a bit before heading out again, not particularly hungry but wanting to soak in the evening. 
            Dinner was at the <strong>Clarens Koöperasie</strong>. We shared a basket of food and had <br />alcohol-free beers 
            while a local duo played sax and guitar. It was pure charm—fun, mellow, <br />a little chaotic. 
            A proper celebration of making it this far.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back at the guesthouse, I showered and collapsed in front of the TV. 
            Some Discovery Channel special about gold mining in rapids was playing. I barely moved. 
            My body was tired, but my mind was full. <strong>We’d started something good.</strong>
